Variations on N Guttenberg's information bottleneck models for evolution of heredity

Basic idea of these models is to impose alternating chaotic/fixed point dynamics on a population of agents, causing an information bottleneck that entrains the agents' internal dynamics.

Agents are on a one dimensional lattice.  Internal agent dynamics are given by the logistic map, alternated with a simple contracting dynamics.
